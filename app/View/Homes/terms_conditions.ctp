    <h3><b>6. Disclaimers and Limitations on GoTabbing's Liability.</b></h3>
    
    <h3><b>6.1 Allocation of Responsibility</b></h3> GoTabbing assumes no responsibility for Documents posted by Users and no responsibility for the activities, omissions or other conduct of Users.

    (a) THE SITES ARE PROVIDED ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. GoTabbing, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES' RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. GoTabbing MAKES NO WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR TIMELINESS OF THE SITES.<br/>
    (b) WITHOUT LIMITATION ON THE FOREGOING:<br/>
    (i) GoTabbing DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITES WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE SITES AND THEIR SERVERS ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL MECHANISMS. IF YOUR USE OF THE SITES RESULTS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR DATA, GoTabbing IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS.<br/>
    (ii) GoTabbing makes no representations or guarantees regarding the truthfulness, accuracy, LEGALITY, completeness, timeliness or reliability of any Documents posted by Users, or of any other form of communication engaged in by Users.

    (iii) GoTabbing makes no representations or guarantees regarding the Content of the SiteS, including, but not limited to, broken links, inaccuracies or typographical errors.<br/>
    (iv) GoTabbing MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SERVICES OR TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICES IN MEETING YOUR EMPLOYMENT OBJECTIVES. GoTabbing DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICES WILL RESULT IN CANDIDATES BEING HIRED, POSITIONS BEING FILLED OR EMPLOYEES BEING RETAINED, AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY BUSINESS, EMPLOYMENT, HIRING AND/OR SALARY DECISIONS, FOR WHATEVER REASON MADE, MADE BY YOU.<br/>
    
    <h3><b>6.4 DAMAGE LIMITATIONS, ALLOCATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF.</b></h3>
    
    (a) YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR YOUR USE OF THE SITES, THE INTERNET GENERALLY, AND THE DOCUMENTS OR EMPLOYER MATERIALS THAT YOU POST, PROVIDE OR ACCESS AND FOR YOUR CONDUCT ON AND OFF THE SITES.<br/>

    <h3><b>6.6 California Residents.</b></h3> If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."
    
    <h3><b>7. Payment of Services upon Termination of Service Activation Agreement.</b></h3> If at any time during the course of this Agreement you should terminate a Service Activation Agreement or any other services Agreement in which these Terms and Conditions have been incorporated by reference, then GoTabbing shall reserve the right to receive all payments from you for the Services used by you up to termination and for fifty percent (50%) of the remaining unused portion of the Service Agreement.

    <h3><b>10. Indemnity.</b></h3> You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless GoTabbing (and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents) from and against any third party claims, actions or demands (including, without limitation, costs, damages and reasonable legal and accounting fees) alleging or resulting from or in connection with your use of the Sites, any Document posted by you, your use of the Services or your breach of this Agreement.

In addition, third parties may retain cached copies of User Information.
    
    <h3><b>12. Questions and Notices.</b></h3> Questions concerning the use of the Sites should be directed to Feedback. Notices to GoTabbing should be sent to the address listed on the Sites.

If you access GoTabbing from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. This Agreement and your Service Activation Agreement, if you have one, are governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Illinois, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Jurisdiction for any claims arising under this Agreement or your Service Activation Agreement shall lie exclusively with the state or federal courts in the State of Illinois. The sole relationship between you and GoTabbing is that of independent contractors. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of all or part of a provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts and provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. All provisions of this Agreement shall survive termination except those granting access or use to the Sites, and you shall cease all your use and access thereof immediately. You may not assign or transfer your obligations under this Agreement. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. Except as expressly provided by GoTabbing in a particular "Legal Notice," or material on particular web pages of the Sites, this Agreement and your Service Activation Agreement where applicable, constitute the entire agreement between you and GoTabbing.

Further, use of the Resume Database by you or by your Authorized RDB Users may not interfere with or violate, in any manner, the privacy election of GoTabbing Job Seekers. You understand and agree that any violation of section 16 will give GoTabbing the right to immediately terminate any and all access to the RDB and to terminate any corresponding Agreements.

Company understands and agrees that if Company uses the Resume Database in violation of the preceding restrictions, then GoTabbing may, at its sole discretion, either terminate Company's Agreement or transfer Company's Seats from the Resume Database to the Targeted Resume Database (a database that only contains individuals whom GoTabbing has identified as appropriate candidates for sales positions where the majority of the compensation is to be derived from commissions).
    
    <h3><b>16.6</b></h3> GoTabbing may terminate, suspend, update, alter or supplement, at its sole discretion, all or any part of the Resume Database at any time.
